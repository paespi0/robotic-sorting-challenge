# Robotic Package Sorting Function

This project contains a function that determines how robotic arms in Thoughtfulâ€™s automation factory should sort packages based on their size and weight.

## ğŸ§  Logic

A package is:
- **Bulky** if volume â‰¥ 1,000,000 cmÂ³ or any dimension â‰¥ 150 cm
- **Heavy** if mass â‰¥ 20 kg

### Stack Rules:
- `REJECTED`: Both bulky and heavy
- `SPECIAL`: Either bulky or heavy
- `STANDARD`: Neither bulky nor heavy

## ğŸš€ Function

```python
sort(width, height, length, mass) -> str
